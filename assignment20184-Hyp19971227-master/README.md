# Binary Search Trees

In this coursework you will be making a Binary Search Tree template class.  As with previous weeks, the coursework has two deadlines: one for the main part, and one for the advanced part.

Note that in answering these questions, you should not add any `#include` or `using` statements: you must implement the functionality yourself, without using any additional data structures from the standard library.  I have added `#include <memory>` for `std::unique_ptr`, `#include <utility>` for `std::pair`, and `#include <iostream>`.  If you have a convincing need for adding a different `#include` please post in the forum on KEATS.

# Binary Search Trees, Main Part (6 marks)

## a) Making a tree node

In the file `treenode.h` implement a template class `TreeNode` that represents a node in a binary search tree.  It should have four `public` member variables:

- The `data` stored in that node.  The type of this should be a template argument.
- A unique_ptr<TreeNode> for the left child of the node;
- A unique_ptr<TreeNode> for the right child of the node;
- A pointer to the parent of the node (NB not a unique_ptr)

Make a constructor that takes an item of data, stores it in the node, and sets the parent pointer to nullptr.

Make a function `setLeftChild(TreeNode* child)` that:

- stores `child` in the left `unique_ptr`
- sets the `parent` pointer of the child to point to `this`

Write an analogous function `setRightChild` for setting the right child of the node.

Make a function `write` that takes an ostream reference, and prints to it:

- The result of calling write on the left child (if there is one)
- A space character
- The data from the node
- A space character
- The result of calling write on the right child (if there is one)

You should then be able to write, e.g:

`someNode->write(cout);`  

...to be able to print the subtree starting at some node to screen.  (NB `write` should be marked as const.)

To test your code, compile and run TestTreeNode.cpp.  A Makefile has been provided, run:

`make TestTreeNode`  

...at the command line.  This makes four tree nodes, linked to each other, then prints out the tree.

## b) Making a tree

In the file `tree.h` implement a template class BinarySearchTree.  This should use the `TreeNode` class you have written so far.

As a private member variable you should have a unique_ptr, `root`, containing a pointer to the root TreeNode.

### Default constructor

Implement an empty default constructor. 

### write

Write a function `write` that takes an `ostream` reference, and calls `write` on the root of the tree.  (NB write should be marked as const.)

### insert

Make a function `insert` that takes an item of data, and inserts it into the tree:

- If the data is not already in the tree, it should make a node and add this in the correct place
- If something equal to the data is already in the tree, it shouldn't make any new nodes, and shouldn't change any of the existing nodes.

In both cases, it should return a `TreeNode*`, pointing to the node containing the data.

Note, in your implementation, you should only compare the data inside nodes by using the `<` operator.  Do not use `>` or `!=` or `==` or any other operator.  For each node, if it has a left child, then `left->data < data`, and if it has a right child, then `data < right->data`.

As an example, if the binary search tree is:

`...4`  
`./...\`  
`2.....7`  

...and 3 is inserted, the tree should become:



`...4`  
`./...\`  
`2.....7`  
`.\`  
`..3`  

..because, starting at the root:

- `3 < 4`, so we need to go to the left
- `2 < 3`, so we need to go to the right
- We've got to the bottom of the tree, so 3 is added as the right child of 2

A pointer to the node containing 3 would then be returned.  (Not a unique_ptr, a normal pointer.)

If 7 is inserted into the tree above, the function should stop when it gets to the node containing 7, and return a pointer to that node.

### find

Write a function `find` that takes an item of data and traverses the Binary Search Tree to see if the data is in the tree.

If it is, it should return a `TreeNode*` pointing to the node containing the data.

If it is not in the tree, it should return `nullptr`

To test your code, compile and run TestTree.cpp.  A Makefile has been provided, run:

`make TestTree`  

### Copy constructor

Write a copy constructor for the BinarySearchTree class.  The copy constructor should make the newly constructed tree be identical to the tree given as input.

The following code should work once you have done this:

`BinarySearchTree<int> a;`  
`a.insert(2);`  
`a.insert(1);`  
`a.insert(3);`  
`BinarySearchTree<int> b = a; // uses the copy constructor`  
`a.write(std::cout); cout << "\n"; // print out a`  
`b.write(std::cout); cout << "\n"; // print out b -- should be the same as a`  

(NB if you like, you can add code to the Node class to help with this.)

### Assignment operator

Write an assignment operator for the BinarySearchTree class.  The assignment operator should make the tree assigned to, be identical to the tree given as input.  The following code should work once you have done this:

`BinarySearchTree<int> a;`  
`a.insert(2);`  
`a.insert(1);`  
`a.insert(3);`  
`BinarySearchTree<int> b;`  
`b = a; // uses the assignment operator`  
`a.write(std::cout); cout << "\n"; // print out a`  
`b.write(std::cout); cout << "\n"; // print out b -- should be the same as a`  

(NB if you like, you can add code to the Node class to help with this.)

## c) TreeMap

### KeyValuePair
In the file `treemap.h`, the incomplete class `KeyValuePair` defines a class that holds a key--value pair, that will be used to make a map.

Complete the class by implementing:

- a Constructor that takes a Key and a Value and stores them in the respective member variables.  *(NB Use the initialisation syntax for this)*
- a Constructor that takes just a Key, and stores this in the relevant member variable *(NB again, use the initialisation syntax)*
- an `operator<` function that compares it to another `KeyValuePair` object, by comparing just the keys (using the < operator).  Remember to use const here correctly.

### TreeMap

In the file `treemap.h`, the incomplete class `TreeMap` defines a class that holds a tree of key--value pairs.

Provided is a function `insert` that takes a Key and a Value, and inserts these into tree as a KeyValuePair.  It then returns a pointer to the *data* inside the tree node returned by `tree->insert`.

Implement a function `find` that takes a Key, makes a KeyValuePair from it, and calls `find` on the tree to see if a match can be found.  If it can be found, return a pointer to the *data* inside the tree node found by find (a `KeyValuePair<Key,Value>*`).  If not, return nullptr.


To test your code, compile and run TestTreeMap.cpp.  A Makefile has been provided, run:

`make TestTreeMap`  

# Binary Search Trees, Advanced Part [3 marks]

## An iterator

In `treenode.h` implement a template class `TreeNodeIterator` that is an iterator over a binary search tree.  As with the ListNodeIterator from the last practical, it should have:

- A single member variable pointing to a TreeNode *and no other member variables*
- A constructor that sets this to point to a given TreeNode
- An `operator*` that dereferences this pointer, and returns it (by reference)
- `operator==` and `operator!=` that compare it to other iterators, by checking if they point to the same (or a different) node
- An increment operator, `operator++` that moves the iterator to point to the next node in the list.


For the tree:

`...4`  
`./...\`  
`2.....7`  
`.\`  
`..3`  


- Incrementing an iterator pointing to 2 should make it point to 3;
- Incrementing an iterator pointing to 3 should make it point to 4;
- Incrementing an iterator pointing to 4 should make it point to 7

In other words, iterator steps through the tree in ascending order.

Extend your `BinarySearchTree` class with `begin()` and `end()` functions that return iterators to the left-most node in the tree (in the tree above -- 2), and nullptr, respectively.

Note that your iterators should still work if additional items are inserted into the tree.  For instance, if we have the tree:

`...5`  
`./...\`  
`1.....9`  
`.\`  
`..3`  

...and have an iterator at the '3' node, then insert 4 into the tree to get:

`...5`  
`./...\`  
`1.....9`  
`.\`  
`..3`  
`   \`  
`    4`  

...then increment our iterator, it should be at the '4' node -- it shouldn't be at the '5' node. 

## maxDepth

In `TreeNode` implement a function maxDepth that returns the maximum depth of the subtree rooted at that node.  If the TreeNode has no children, it has depth 1.  Otherwise, its depth is 1 + the maximum of either the depth of its left child, or the depth of its right child.

In `BinarySearchTree` implement a function maxDepth that returns the maxDepth of the root (or 0 for an empty tree).

## AVL trees

In the worst case, when using a Binary Search Tree, the data is adding in ascending order, giving the following tree:

`A`  
`.\`  
`..B`  
`...\`  
`....C`  


That is, the depth of the tree is the same as the number of elements.  What we ideally want is a balanced tree, where the depth of the tree is *log(N)* in the number of elements, N.

AVL trees rebalance the tree every time a node is inserted.  This is done by computing the *balance factor* of that node.  It is computed as:

`balanceFactor(node) = maxDepth(left node) - maxDepth(right node)`

If this balance factor is ever 2, or -2, the tree beneath that node needs to be rebalanced: it is much deeper on one side than the other.  For the following tree:


`A`  
`.\`  
`..B`  
`...\`  
`....C`  


...the balance factors are:


`-2`  
`.\`  
`..-1`  
`...\`  
`....0`  


...because looking at the root, the depth of the right subtree is 2; but the depth of the left subtree is 0.

To become rebalanced, an AVL tree performs one of four operations.  Perform these where needed in your implementation of `insert` in the BinarySearchTree class.  After inserting a node you will need to look at its parent, and its parent's parent; compute the balance factor of its parent's parent; and if the tree is then unbalanced, perform the appropriate operation.

(A full AVL tree implementation does a bit more than this, but implementing the cases described here is sufficient for this assignment.)

### Left rotation

If a node becomes unbalanced, when a node is inserted into the right subtree of its right child, then we perform a left rotation.  This is best shown with an example.  Suppose we had the subtree:

`A`  
`.\`  
`..B`  


...and added 'C', we would get:

`A`  
`.\`  
`..B`  
`...\`  
`....C`  

*C* is what we have just inserted; *B* is its parent; *A* is its parent's parent.

*A* now has a balance factor of -2, so we left rotate: we reorder the nodes so that B is the root of this subtree instead of A:

`..B`  
`./.\`  
`A...C`  


Each of these now has a balance factor of 0, so it is balanced again.

Note if A had a parent, B is attached to this, replacing A.

### Right rotation

If a node becomes unbalanced when a node is inserted into the left subtree of its left child, then we perform a right rotation.  Suppose we had the tree:

`....C`  
`.../ `  
`..B`  

...and added 'A', we would get:

`....C`  
`.../ `  
`..B`  
`./`  
`A`  

C is now unbalanced: its balance factor is 2, because its left child has depth 2, but its right child is empty (depth 0).  Thus, we right rotate: we reorder the nodes so that B is the root of this subtree instead of C:

`..B`  
`./.\`  
`A...C`  

Note if C had a parent, B is attached to this, replacing C.

### Left-Right rotation

If a node becomes unbalanced when a node is inserted into the right subtree of its left child, then we perform a left-right rotation.  If we had the tree:

`....C`  
`.../ `  
`..A`  

...and added B, we would get:

`....C`  
`.../ `  
`..A`  
`..\`  
`...B`  

C is now unbalanced.  This scenario is fixed by performing a left--right rotation.  First, we perform a left rotation on the subtree rooted at A, making B the root of this subtree:

`....C`  
`.../ `  
`..B`  
`./`  
`A`  

Then, we perform a right rotation on C, making B the root of this subtree:

`..B`  
`./.\`  
`A...C`  

Note if C had a parent, B is attached to this, replacing C.

### Right-left rotation

One scenario left: a node becomes unbalanced when a node is inserted into the left subtree of its right child, then we perform a right-left rotation.  If we had the tree:

`....A`  
`.....\ `  
`......C`  

... and added B, we would get:

`....A`  
`.....\ `  
`......C`  
`...../`  
`....B`  

A is now unbalanced.  A right-left rotation fixes this in two stages.  First, we perform a right rotation on the subtree rooted at C:

`....A`  
`.....\ `  
`......B`  
`.......\`  
`........C`  

Then, we perform a left rotation on A, making B the root of this subtree:

`..B`  
`./.\`  
`A...C`  

Note if A had a parent, B is attached to this, replacing A.
